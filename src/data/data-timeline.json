Despite improvements in moderation and transparency, the platform still allows significant amounts of extremist content, raising concerns about its commitment to preventing the spread of harmful material. The Christchurch attack video has been viewed over 150,000 times on BitChute, and while some flagged content has been removed, critics argue that it remains a haven for hate speech and dangerous disinformation",

BitChute, a British video-hosting site, is particularly notable for being rife with racism and hate speech, and it enables influencers to monetize such content despite its defiant stance on moderation. The investigation reveals a widespread practice among these figures to use alt-tech platforms such as Telegram, BitChute, and Gab, which provide havens for unmoderated hate speech and extremist content",

In May, both companies will release APIs that enable interoperability between Android and iOS devices using apps from public health authorities and in the coming months, Apple and Google will work to enable a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into their underlying platforms. They emphasise that this is a more robust solution than an API and would allow more individuals to participate, if they choose to opt in, as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities",

This law obliges platforms to delete illegal content within 24 hours and flag it to the Office of the Federal Criminal Police. Critics argue that far-right influencers use platforms like BitChute to evade stricter regulations on mainstream sites, thus reducing the effectiveness of the law",
